python is a magical creature that achieves things that we can not even comprehend liek automating donations

basically for fundraising, I need to be able to scan pledge cards using a scanner that saves the images of the pledge cards to a folder on the PC.
this code should then detect a new image, upload it to a specific google drive folder and then make a new hyperlink to that image in the google drive in a google sheet.
it has to be very reliable because processing of cards needs to happen in-real-time at a fundraising dinner, it could determine the faith of upto a million dollars
